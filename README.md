# Lathe.js
Lathe.js is a high-performance, volumetric 2D sprite engine that transforms flat sheets into dynamic 3D puppets. Using a unique "vertical-strip" mapping technique, it wraps textures around cylindrical volumes in real-time. Features include pixel-perfect auto-deduplication, multi-actor configuration, and physics-driven bobbing. 🧅🏺✨
